# üìÅ Webhooks 
Humanos provides a comprehensive webhook system that allows organizations to receive real-time notifications when specific events occur in their processes. The webhook system supports two levels of granularity to provide maximum flexibility. Organizations have full flexibility to specify the exact URL paths where webhooks should be sent to.

1. **Organization Level** (Fallback): Default webhooks for the entire organization
    
2. **Resource Level**: Specific webhooks for different types of resources (forms, documents, consents, KYC)
    

To configure the webhook system, organization administrators can navigate to [Humanos Admin ‚Äì Webhooks](https://app.humanos.id/admin/webhooks). The following image illustrates an example configuration:

- An **Organization-Level Webhook** is defined, which will receive all notifications for **KYC** and **Signature** events, since no resource-specific webhooks have been configured for those event types.
- **Form events** will be delivered to [https://your.domain.com/webhook/forms](http://your.domain.com/webhook/forms).
- **Consent events** will be delivered to [https://your.domain.com/webhook/consents](http://your.domain.com/webhook/consents).
- **Signature Secret** is used for validating that the webhooks were sent by Humanos.
- **Encryption Secret** is used for decrypting the payloads, ensuring security on transit.
- **Encryption Salt** is used together with the Encryption Secret to derive the final encryption key. The salt adds uniqueness and protects against dictionary or pre-computed attacks, ensuring stronger security for each payload.

The following code snippet implements an express API containing an endpoint to deal with Humanos Webhook notifications. The request should be handeled as follows:

1. **Receive the request** ‚Üí Your endpoint will be called with an encrypted payload.
2. **Verify authenticity** ‚Üí Check the x-signature header using your **Signature Secret**.
3. **Decrypt the payload** ‚Üí Use the **Encryption Secret** to decrypt the message and read the event data.
4. **Process the event** ‚Üí Store it in your system, update statuses, or trigger business logic.
5. **Respond quickly** ‚Üí Always return **200 OK** after successful processing. Humanos retries failed deliveries automatically.

``` javascript
const express = require("express");
const crypto = require("crypto");
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
const SIGNATURE_SECRET = "your-signature-secret";
const ENCRYPTION_SECRET = "your-encryption-secret";
const ENCRYPTION_SALT = "your-encryption-salt"
app.post("/webhook", (req, res) => {
  try {
    const signature = req.headers["x-signature"];
    const timestamp = req.headers["x-timestamp"];
    // 1. Verify signature
    const expected = generateSignature(req.body, SIGNATURE_SECRET, timestamp);
    if (signature !== expected) return res.status(401).send("Invalid signature");
    // 2. Decrypt payload
    const { iv, data, tag } = req.body;
    const key = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(
      Buffer.from(ENCRYPTION_SECRET, "base64"),
      ENCRYPTION_SALT,
      10000,
      32,
      "sha256"
    );
    const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(
      "aes-256-gcm",
      key,
      Buffer.from(iv, "base64")
    );
    decipher.setAuthTag(Buffer.from(tag, "base64"));
    const decrypted = Buffer.concat([
      decipher.update(Buffer.from(data, "base64")),
      decipher.final(),
    ]).toString("utf8");
    const webhook = JSON.parse(decrypted);
    console.log("Webhook received:", webhook);
    res.sendStatus(200);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).send(err.message);
  }
});
app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Listening on port 3000"));
